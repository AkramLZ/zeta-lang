# ALPHA STAGES
# zeta-lang 
New generation of JIT like you've never seen.

Example:

```
main() {
    println_str("Hello, World!!!")
    println_int(49)

    let something: boolean = true
    if (something) {
        let num: i32 = 49 + (23 * 39)
        println_int(num)
    }
}
```

A memory-safe, low-level, JIT-compiled, to be made in a new generation of languages like you've never seen, with extremely fast compilation.

A language made to **touch the realms of possibility** in JIT, memory management and performance

# Why Zeta?
- JIT compilation: JIT compilation of zeta empowers many aspects of the language, such as long uptime performance, automatic profiling and no need to compile for every platform

- Performant: Incredibly fast language, there's no garbage collection, no class loading, no dynamic typing, no type erasure (runtime monomorphization), no reflection (there's compile time meta programming)

- Memory Safety: Memory safe language using lifetime sets, considerably safer than other languages like C without garbage collection like java, c#, go, python, javascript and typescript, while being relatively easy to learn

- Extremely Versatile: Once alpha stages hits, versatility in the language will be on top of many major languages (You'll see ðŸ˜‰)

I might be making insane claims, but the language development has been promising these results ^^
