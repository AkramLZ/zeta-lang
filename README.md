# ALPHA STAGES
# zeta-lang 
New generation of JIT like you've never seen.

Example:

```
main() {
    println_str("Hello, World!!!")
    println_int(49)

    let something: boolean = true
    if (something) {
        let num: i32 = 49 + (23 * 39)
        println_int(num)
    }
}
```

A memory-safe, low-level, JIT-compiled, to be made in a new generation of languages like you've never seen, with extremely fast compilation.

A language made to **touch the realms of possibility** in JIT, memory management and performance

| Category | **Zetaâ€™s Uniqueness** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Concurrency** | Combines simplicity with fine-grained control (fiber-level scheduling, profiling) |
| **Performance Tuning** | Explicit memory regions, no GC, JIT profile-directed optimizations |
| **Memory Safety** | Combines region sets with typed pointer rules |
| **Metaprogramming** | AST-level, powerful compile-time capabilities without runtime overhead |
| **Embeddability** | JIT-executed, modular VM is suitable for embedding in games, tools, and kernels |
